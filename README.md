# Hyperbolic!

This is still an incomplete version of Hyperbolic! You can play with
it, but it's still oriented towards development and testing.

To run what is available right now, just launch `draw.py`.

## Commands

You can rotate the hyperbolic plane around a point just moving the
mouse pointer to that point and scrolling the mouse wheel.

So far it isn't possibile to do anything else...

Stay tuned!
