# Hyperbolic!

This is still an incomplete version of Hyperbolic! You can play with
it, but it's still oriented towards development and testing.

To run what is available right now, just launch `draw.py`.

## Move the hyperbolic plane

You can rotate the hyperbolic plane (i.e., making an elliptic
transformation) around a point just moving the mouse pointer to that
point and scrolling the mouse wheel.

You can translate the hyperbolic plane (i.e., making a hyperbolic
transformation) along a segment just clicking in one point and then
releasing the mouse button in another.

There is so far no way to make parabolic transformations, although you
can just replace them with elliptic transformations whose fixed point
is very close to the border.

## Other commands

 * Pressing key `M` you can switch between the Poincar√© and Klein
   model for the hyperbolic plane.

So far it isn't possibile to do anything else...

Stay tuned!
